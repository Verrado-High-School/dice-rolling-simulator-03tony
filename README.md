# Dice-Sim (50 points)

## **Directions**

You will be creating a die rolling simulator. Your program should

1. Ask the user to input the number of times a 6 sided die will be rolled (5 points)
1. Create a while loop that will run the number of times inputed (5 points)
### During each loop your program should:
1. Generate a random number from 1 to six (5 points)
1. output what roll number is currently being generated and the result. Example: Roll 100: 4 (5 points)
1. Keep a count of the results (how many 1s, 2s, 3s, etc.) (10 points)
### After the loop your program should output the results including:
1. The total number of rolls (5 points)
1. The total number of 1s, 2s, 3s,..., 6s (10 points)
1. The percentage of each result (5 points)

### Example output for 100 rolls
Total Rolls: 100

1s - 16<br>
2s - 20<br>
3s - 18<br>
4s - 17<br>
5s - 18<br>
6s - 11<br>

1s - 16%<br>
2s - 20%<br>
3s - 18%<br>
4s - 17%<br>
5s - 18%<br>
6s - 11%
